title: Device Graphs

description: |
  The hierarchical organisation of the device tree is well suited to describe
  control flow to devices, but there can be more complex connections between
  devices that work together to form a logical compound device, following an
  arbitrarily complex graph.
  There already is a simple directed graph between devices tree nodes using
  phandle properties pointing to other nodes to describe connections that
  can not be inferred from device tree parent-child relationships. The device
  tree graph bindings described herein abstract more complex devices that can
  have multiple specifiable ports, each of which can be linked to one or more
  ports of other devices.

  These common bindings do not contain any information about the direction or
  type of the connections, they just map their existence. Specific properties
  may be described by specialized bindings depending on the type of connection.

  To see how this binding applies to video pipelines, for example, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
  Here the ports describe data interfaces, and the links between them are
  the connecting data buses. A single port with multiple connections can
  correspond to multiple devices being connected to the same physical bus.

  # Organisation of ports and endpoints:
  #
  # Ports are described by child 'port' nodes contained in the device node.
  # Each port node contains an 'endpoint' subnode for each remote device port
  # connected to this port. If a single port is connected to more than one
  # remote device, an 'endpoint' child node must be provided for each link.
  # If more than one port is present in a device node or there is more than
  # one endpoint at a port, or a port node needs to be associated with a
  # selected hardware interface, a common scheme using '#address-cells',
  # '#size-cells' and 'reg' properties is used to number the nodes.
