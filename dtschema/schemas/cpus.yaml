title: Common cpus binding

description: |+
  In Devicetree data files, the layout of CPUs is described in the
  "cpus" node.  This node in turn contains a number of subnodes
  representing CPUs, which define properties for every cpu.

  Bindings for CPU nodes follow the Devicetree Specification, available from:

  https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/

properties:
  $nodename:
    const: cpus
    description:
      A /cpus node is required for all Devicetrees.  It does not represent
      a real device in the system, but acts as a container for child "cpu"
      nodes which represent the systems' CPUs.

  '#address-cells':
    minimum: 1
    description:
      The value specifies how many cells each element of the reg property
      array takes in children of this node.

  '#size-cells':
    const: 0

patternProperties:
  '^cpu@[0-9a-f]+$':
    $ref: cpu.yaml#

required:
  - '#address-cells'
  - '#size-cells'
