title: Common cpus binding

description: |+
  In Devicetree data files, the layout of CPUs is described in the
  "cpus" node.  This node in turn contains a number of subnodes
  representing CPUs, which define properties for every cpu.

  Bindings for CPU nodes follow the Devicetree Specification, available from:

  https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/

properties:
  $nodename:
    const: cpus
    description:
      A /cpus node is required for all Devicetrees.  It does not represent
      a real device in the system, but acts as a container for child "cpu"
      nodes which represent the systems' CPUs.

  '#address-cells':
    minimum: 1
    description:
      The value specifies how many cells each element of the reg property
      array takes in children of this node.

  '#size-cells':
    const: 0

patternProperties:
  '^cpu@[0-9a-f]+$':
    type: object
    properties:
      device_type:
        const: cpu

      reg:
        description:
          Defines a unique CPU/thread ID for the CPU/threads represented
          by the CPU node.

      compatible: true

      clock-frequency:
        description:
          Specifies the current clock speed of the CPU in Hertz.

      timebase-frequency:
        oneOf:
          - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
          - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
        minimum: 1
        description:
          Specifies the current frequency at which the timebase and the
          decrementer registers are updated (in Hertz).

      status:
        $ref: "types.yaml#/definitions/string"
        enum: [ okay, disabled, fail ]
        description:
          A standard property describing the state of a CPU. A CPU may be
          running ("okay"), in a quiescent state ("disabled") or be not
          operational or not exist ("fail").

      enable-method:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string-array
        description:
          Describes the method by which a CPU in a disabled state is enabled.
          This property is required for CPUs with a status property with a
          value of "disabled".  The value consists of one or more strings
          that define the method to release this CPU.  If a client program
          recognizes any of the methods, it may use it.

      cpu-release-addr:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
        description:
          This value specifies the physical address of a spin table entry that
          releases a secondary CPU from its spin loop.

      cache-op-block-size:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
        description:
          Specifies the block size in bytes upon which cache block instructions
          operate.  Required if different than the L1 cache block size.

      reservation-granule-size:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
        description:
          Specifies the reservation granule size supported by this processor
          in bytes.

      mmu-type:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
        description:
          Specifies the CPU's MMU type.

      tlb-split:
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
        description:
          If present, specifies that the TLB has a split configuration, with
          separate TLBs for instructions and data.  If absent, specifies that
          the TLB has a unified configuration.  Required for a CPU with a
          TLB in a split configuration.

    patternProperties:
      "^(i-|d-|)tlb-(size|sets)$":
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
        minimum: 1

          - device_type
