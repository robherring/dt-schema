  i2c-scl-falling-time-ns:
    description:
      Number of nanoseconds the SCL signal takes to fall; t(f) in the I2C
      specification.

  i2c-scl-internal-delay-ns:
    description:
      Number of nanoseconds the IP core additionally needs to setup SCL.

  i2c-scl-rising-time-ns:
    description:
      Number of nanoseconds the SCL signal takes to rise; t(r) in the I2C
      specification.

  i2c-scl-clk-low-timeout-us:
    description:
      Number of microseconds the clock line needs to be pulled down in order
      to force a waiting state.

  i2c-scl-has-clk-low-timeout:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Indicates whether the controller implements the feature of wait
      induction through SCL low, with the timeout being implemented
      internally by the controller.

  i2c-sda-falling-time-ns:
    description:
      Number of nanoseconds the SDA signal takes to fall; t(f) in the I2C
      specification.

  i2c-analog-filter:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Enable analog filter for i2c lines.

  i2c-digital-filter:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Enable digital filter for i2c lines.

  i2c-digital-filter-width-ns:
    description:
      Width of spikes which can be filtered by digital filter
      (i2c-digital-filter). This width is specified in nanoseconds.

  i2c-analog-filter-cutoff-frequency:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Frequency that the analog filter (i2c-analog-filter) uses to distinguish
      which signal to filter. Signal with higher frequency than specified will
      be filtered out. Only lower frequency will pass (this is applicable to a
      low-pass analog filter). Typical value should be above the normal i2c bus
      clock frequency (clock-frequency). Specified in Hz.

  mctp-controller:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Indicates that the system is accessible via this bus as an endpoint for
      MCTP over I2C transport.

  multi-master:
    type: boolean
    description:
      States that there is another master active on this bus. The OS can use
      this information to adapt power management to keep the arbitration awake
      all the time, for example. Can not be combined with 'single-master'.

  scl-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Specifies the GPIO related to SCL pin. Used for GPIO bus recovery.

  sda-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Specifies the GPIO related to SDA pin. Optional for GPIO bus recovery.

  single-master:
    type: boolean
    description:
      States that there is no other master active on this bus. The OS can use
      this information to detect a stalled bus more reliably, for example. Can
      not be combined with 'multi-master'.

  smbus:
    type: boolean
    description:
      States that additional SMBus restrictions and features apply to this bus.
      An example of feature is SMBusHostNotify. Examples of restrictions are
      more reserved addresses and timeout definitions.

  smbus-alert:
    type: boolean
    description:
      states that the optional SMBus-Alert feature apply to this bus.

  no-detect:
    type: boolean
    description:
      States that no other devices are present on this bus other than the ones
      listed in the devicetree.

        description: |
          One or many I2C slave addresses. These are usually a 7 bit addresses.
          However, flags can be attached to an address. I2C_TEN_BIT_ADDRESS is
          used to mark a 10 bit address. It is needed to avoid the ambiguity
          between e.g. a 7 bit address of 0x50 and a 10 bit address of 0x050
          which, in theory, can be on the same bus.
          Another flag is I2C_OWN_SLAVE_ADDRESS to mark addresses on which we
          listen to be devices ourselves.

      host-notify:
        type: boolean
        description:
          Device uses SMBus host notify protocol instead of interrupt line.
          Requires being connected to an adapter that supports this feature.

      interrupts:
        description:
          I2C core will treat "irq" interrupt (or the very first interrupt if
          not using interrupt names) as primary interrupt for the slave.

                - wakeup
                - smbus_alert
            description:
              Names which are recognized by I2C core, other names are left to
              individual bindings.

      wakeup-source:
        description:
          Device can be used as a wakeup source. The device should also have
          "wakeup" interrupt for the device. If "wakeup" interrupt name is not
          present in the binding, then primary interrupt will be used as wakeup
          interrupt.
