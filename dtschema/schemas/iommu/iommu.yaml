    description:
      Some masters support multiple address spaces for DMA, by tagging DMA
      transactions with an address space identifier. By default, this is 0,
      which means that the device only has one address space.
    default: 0

    description: >
      When present, the master can wait for a transaction to complete for an
      indefinite amount of time. Upon translation fault some IOMMUs, instead of
      aborting the translation immediately, may first notify the driver and keep
      the transaction in flight. This allows the OS to inspect the fault and,
      for example, make physical pages resident before updating the mappings and
      completing the transaction. Such IOMMU accepts a limited number of
      simultaneous stalled transactions before having to either put
      back-pressure on the master, or abort new faulting transactions.

      Firmware has to opt-in stalling, because most buses and masters don't
      support it. In particular it isn't compatible with PCI, where transactions
      have to complete before a time limit. More generally it won't work in
      systems and masters that haven't been designed for stalling. For example
      the OS, in order to handle a stalled transaction, may attempt to retrieve
      pages from secondary storage in a stalled domain, leading to a deadlock.
