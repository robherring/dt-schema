description: |+
  In Devicetree data files, the layout of CPUs is described in the
  "cpus" node.  This node in turn contains a number of subnodes
  representing CPUs, which define properties for every cpu.

  Bindings for CPU nodes follow the Devicetree Specification, available from:

  https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/

    description:
      Defines a unique CPU/thread ID for the CPU/threads represented
      by the CPU node.

    description:
      Specifies the current frequency at which the timebase and the
      decrementer registers are updated (in Hertz).

  status:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/string
    enum: [ okay, disabled, fail ]
    description:
      A standard property describing the state of a CPU. A CPU may be
      running ("okay"), in a quiescent state ("disabled") or be not
      operational or not exist ("fail").

  enable-method:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string-array
    description:
      Describes the method by which a CPU in a disabled state is enabled.
      This property is required for CPUs with a status property with a
      value of "disabled".  The value consists of one or more strings
      that define the method to release this CPU.  If a client program
      recognizes any of the methods, it may use it.

  cpu-release-addr:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
    description:
      This value specifies the physical address of a spin table entry that
      releases a secondary CPU from its spin loop.

  cache-op-block-size:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Specifies the block size in bytes upon which cache block instructions
      operate.  Required if different than the L1 cache block size.

  reservation-granule-size:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Specifies the reservation granule size supported by this processor
      in bytes.

  numa-node-id: true

  mmu-type:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
    description:
      Specifies the CPU's MMU type.

  operating-points-v2: true

  tlb-split:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
    description:
      If present, specifies that the TLB has a split configuration, with
      separate TLBs for instructions and data.  If absent, specifies that
      the TLB has a unified configuration.  Required for a CPU with a
      TLB in a split configuration.
