description:
  This binding describes generic properties that can be applied to an
  IIO device binding.

  As well, direct readings of channels on an IIO Device, an IIO device
  can provide services in the form of readings and properties for
  channels to consumer devices.  For example, an ADC might provide
  3 channels to an analog accelerometer so that an accelerometer
  driver can use them to read the voltages that correspond to the
  accelerations on the 3 axis.

properties:
  "#io-channel-cells":
    enum: [0, 1, 2]
    description: >
      Number of cells in an IIO specifier; Typically 0 for nodes
      with a single IIO output and 1 for nodes with multiple IIO outputs.
      A few unusual devices have a 2 level mapping.

  label:
    description:
      Unique name to identify which IIO channel or device this is.
