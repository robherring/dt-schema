description:
  This binding describes generic properties a consumer of the channels
  provided by an IIO device may use.

  As well, direct readings of channels on an IIO Device, an IIO device
  can provide services to consumer devices. Thes are in the form of channel
  readings and properties.  For example, an ADC might provide 3 channels to
  an analog accelerometer so that an accelerometer driver can use them to
  read the voltages that correspond to the accelerations on the 3 axis and
  apply appropriate calibration to provide useful outputs.

      List of phandle and IIO specifier pairs, one pair for each IIO input
      to the device. Note: if the IIO provider specifies '0' for
      #io-channel-cells, then only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.
