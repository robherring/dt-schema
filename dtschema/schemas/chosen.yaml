title: /chosen Node

maintainers:
  - Devicetree Specification Mailing List <devicetree-spec@vger.kernel.org>

description:
  The chosen node does not represent a real device, but serves as a place
  for passing data between firmware and the operating system, like boot
  arguments. Data in the chosen node does not represent the hardware.

properties:
  $nodename:
    const: chosen

  "#address-cells": true
  "#size-cells": true
  ranges: true

  bootargs:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/string

  kaslr-seed:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
    description:
      This property is used when booting with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE as the
      entropy used to randomize the kernel image base address location. Since
      it is used directly, this value is intended only for KASLR, and should
      not be used for other purposes (as it may leak information about KASLR
      offsets). It is parsed as a u64 value, e.g.

      /{
              chosen {
                      kaslr-seed = <0xfeedbeef 0xc0def00d>;
              };
      };

      Note that if this property is set from UEFI (or a bootloader in EFI
      mode) when EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL is supported, it will be overwritten by
      the Linux EFI stub (which will populate the property itself, using
      EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL).

  rng-seed:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint8-array
    description:
      This property served as an entropy to add device randomness. It is parsed
      as a byte array, e.g.

      /{
             chosen {
                     rng-seed = /bits/ 8 <0x31 0x95 0x1b 0x3c 0xc9 0xfa ...>;
             };
      };

      This random value should be provided by bootloader.

  linux,booted-from-kexec:
    type: boolean
    description:
      This property is set (currently only on PowerPC, and only needed on
      book3e) by some versions of kexec-tools to tell the new kernel that it
      is being booted by kexec, as the booting environment may differ (e.g.
      a different secondary CPU release mechanism).

  linux,elfcorehdr:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint64-array
    maxItems: 2
    description: |
      This property holds the memory range, the address and the size, of the
      elf core header which mainly describes the panicked kernel\'s memory
      layout as PT_LOAD segments of elf format.

      / {
              chosen {
                      linux,elfcorehdr = <0x9 0xfffff000 0x0 0x800>;
              };
      };

      While this property does not represent a real hardware, the address
      and the size are expressed in #address-cells and #size-cells,
      respectively, of the root node.

  linux,usable-memory-range:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint64-array
    maxItems: 2
    description: |
      This property holds a base address and size, describing a limited region
      in which memory may be considered available for use by the kernel. Memory
      outside of this range is not available for use.

      This property describes a limitation: memory within this range is only
      valid when also described through another mechanism that the kernel
      would otherwise use to determine available memory (e.g. memory nodes
      or the EFI memory map). Valid memory may be sparse within the range.

      / {
              chosen {
                      linux,usable-memory-range = <0x9 0xf0000000 0x0 0x10000000>;
              };
      };

      The main usage is for crash dump kernel to identify its own usable
      memory and exclude, at its boot time, any other memory areas that are
      part of the panicked kernel\'s memory.

      While this property does not represent a real hardware, the address
      and the size are expressed in #address-cells and #size-cells,
      respectively, of the root node.

  linux,initrd-start:
    oneOf:
      - $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
      - $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
    description:
      These properties hold the physical start and end address of an initrd that\'s
      loaded by the bootloader. Note that linux,initrd-start is inclusive, but
      linux,initrd-end is exclusive.

  linux,initrd-end:
    oneOf:
      - $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
      - $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
    description:
      These properties hold the physical start and end address of an initrd that\'s
      loaded by the bootloader. Note that linux,initrd-start is inclusive, but
      linux,initrd-end is exclusive.

  linux,pci-probe-only:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [ 0, 1 ]
    description:
      Optional property which takes a single-cell argument. If '0', then Linux
      will assign devices in its usual manner, otherwise it will not try to
      assign devices and instead use them as they are configured already.

  stdout-path:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/string
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9@/,+\\-._]*(:[0-9]*[noe]?[78]?[r]?)?$"
    description: |
      Device trees may specify the device to be used for boot console output
      with a stdout-path property under /chosen, as described in the Devicetree
      Specification, e.g.

      / {
        chosen {
                stdout-path = "/serial@f00:115200";
        };

        serial@f00 {
                compatible = "vendor,some-uart";
                reg = <0xf00 0x10>;
        };
      };

      If the character ":" is present in the value, this terminates the path.
      The meaning of any characters following the ":" is device-specific, and
      must be specified in the relevant binding documentation.

      For UART devices, the preferred binding is a string in the form:

        <baud>{<parity>{<bits>{<flow>}}}

      where

        baud    - baud rate in decimal
        parity  - 'n' (none), 'o', (odd) or 'e' (even)
        bits    - number of data bits
        flow    - 'r' (rts)

      For example: 115200n8r

      Implementation note: Linux will look for the property "linux,stdout-path"
      or on PowerPC "stdout" if "stdout-path" is not found.  However, the
      "linux,stdout-path" and "stdout" properties are deprecated. New platforms
      should only use the "stdout-path" property.

  linux,ima-kexec-buffer:
    $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint64-array
    maxItems: 2
    description: |
      This property(currently used by powerpc, arm64) holds the memory range,
      "the address and the size", of the Integrity Measurement Architecture(IMA)
      measurement logs that are being carried over to the new kernel.

      / {
          chosen {
              linux,ima-kexec-buffer = <0x9 0x82000000 0x0 0x00008000>;
          };
      };

      This property does not represent real hardware, but the memory allocated for
      carrying the IMA measurement logs. The address and the size are expressed in
      #address-cells and #size-cells, respectively of the root node.

  linux,tpm-kexec-buffer:
    $ref: types.yaml#definitions/uint64-array
    maxItems: 2
    description: |
      This property (currently used by powerpc64) holds the memory range,
      "the address and the size", of the TPM's measurement log that is being
      carried over to the new kernel.

      / {
          chosen {
              linux,tpm-kexec-buffer = <0x9 0x82000000 0x0 0x00008000>;
          };
      };

      This property does not represent real hardware, but the memory allocated for
      carrying the TPM measurement log. The address and the size are expressed in
      #address-cells and #size-cells, respectively of the root node.

  linux,uefi-system-table:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
    description:
      Physical address of the UEFI System Table.

  linux,uefi-mmap-start:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint64
    description:
      Physical address of the UEFI memory map, populated by the UEFI
      GetMemoryMap() call.

  linux,uefi-mmap-size:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Size in bytes of the UEFI memory map pointed to by linux,uefi-mmap-start.

  linux,uefi-mmap-desc-size:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Size in bytes of each entry in the UEFI memory map.

  linux,uefi-mmap-desc-ver:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Version of the mmap descriptor format.

  u-boot,bootconf:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/string
    description:
      This property can be used by U-Boot to pass the selected configuration unit
      name of the booted image down to the operating system.

  u-boot,version:
    $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/string
    pattern: "^20[0-9]{2}\\.[0-9]{2}.*$"
    description:
      This property is used by U-Boot to pass its version down to the operating
      system.
